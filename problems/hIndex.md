### **December {date} - Dr. Bruce Banner's H-Index**
  - **Problem**
    - Dr. Bruce Banner is a soft-spoken scientist and among Earth's most brilliant men. At this moment though, he needs your help to find his h-index.
    - In academia, the h-index is a metric used to calculate the impact of a researcher's papers. It is calculated as follows:
    - A researcher has index h if at least h of his N papers have h citations each. If there are multiple h satisfying this formula, the maximum is chosen.
    - For example, suppose `N = 5`, and the respective citations of each paper are `[4, 3, 0, 1, 5]`
    - Then the h-index would be `3`, since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations.
    - Given a list of paper citations of Dr. Bruce Banner, calculate his h-index.

  - **Example**
      ```bash
      > h_index(5, [4,3,0,1,5])
        3
      > h_index(6, [4,5,2,0,6,4])
        4
      ```
